==========================

[![Through-Hole Christmas Kit](https://dlnmh9ip6v2uc.cloudfront.net/images/products/9/5/6/5/09565-01_i_ma.jpg)  
*It's A Through-Hole Christmas, Charlie Brown! (KIT-09565)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9565)

This ornamental kit comes with a neatly-cut, tree-shaped PCB, adorned with super-bright green LEDs, and topped with a yellow LED.
The LEDs are controlled by a pre-programmed ATtiny85 AVR, and the circuit is powered by a couple AA batteries. 
All compnents are through-hole, so this is a great kit for that first-time solderer.
